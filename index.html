    <h2>LIFE EXPERIENCES</h2>
    <div class="bg" style="height:500px;">
        <div class="text" style="height:500px;">
            <p>Every one of us faces adversities. 
                It is a universal human experience. 
                Despite this, every one of us perceives, responds,
                and recovers from them differently.</p> 
            <p>I, myself, undeniably find it difficult to get through 
                hard and challenging times, especially because of my 
                pessimistic nature. There have been times that I have 
                failure and consequently, grief, during my stay in the 
                university to the point that I wanted to leave. One of
                the instances I would never forget was me knowing that
                I was gonna fail the course yet I took the final exam 
                anyway. This, in the end, made me miss the last moments
                of my pet dog named Cola, who I left in my parents care
                while I am studying in the university. If I had known of 
                her worsening condition, I would have went home right away.
                This precisely was the reason why my family waited for
                the exam to be over before telling me. It might have hurt 
                to be the last person to know of her death, but I understand 
                that my family had my best interest in mind. </p>
            <p>I still have regrets and failures that haunt me to this day.
                The one thing that comforts me now is believing that
                everything happens for a reason. Not everyone subscribes to
                this belief and even I have some reservations about it, 
                but I think it would be best for me to believe. There are always
                more than one way to look at things. People generally either look
                on either the negative or positive side of things. It is fine to 
                recognize that bad things happen, and there sometimes are really 
                no reason for it. It's fine to think about them but it's important
                to know when to stop, and when to actually turn that bad thing into
                something good or useful to you. I still blame myself for not 
                being there for Cola because I was the reason why I had to 
                take the final exam. It was my ultimately my fault that I was not
                able to be there for her. This series of events has been 
                a real eye-opener. I have gotten motivated to actually 
                exert effort in my academics, just so that this kind of thing would
                not happen again with my other pets.</p>
            <p>This goes to show that I may have experienced failures time and time 
                again, and I will continue to do so, but I have yet to fail on getting 
                back on my feet every single time.
